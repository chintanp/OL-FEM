OL-FEM
======

This is the repository for storing files related to the development project "OLFEM". 

**OL-FEM** is the abbreviation for OnLine - Finite Element Modelling. 

This project will have sub-projects which specialise in bringing the OL-FEM functionality to various disciplines including structural analysis (**StrAn**), heat and mass transfer(**HMT**), computational fluid dynamics(**CFD**) etc. 

StrAn should
 * allow modelling of variuos type of structural elements found in common use like *beams*, *columns*, *slabs*, etc. 
 * Definition of common geometries as well as complicated geometries should be possible by the use of an import option.
 * Further, it should allow attaching information regarding the material properties to the created geometry. 
 * It should then be possible to define nodes on the geometry and discretize the geometry if needed.
